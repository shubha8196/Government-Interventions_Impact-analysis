# Impact Analysis of human mobility and government interventions effects on the spread of COVID-19
County Assigned: Jefferson County (Kentucky, US)


## Goal

The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected peopleâ€™s lives, world economies, and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. In the absence of a vaccine or an effective treatment, the rapid spread of the disease elicited a wide range of responses from different governments across the globe to contain the spread of the pandemic.
It is well known that the US government had also adopted several interventions apart from the mask mandate policy like travel restrictions, ban on large gatherings, stay-at-home orders, etc., to determine the set of restrictions that will effectively help remediate the spread of COVID-19 without excessively limiting the economic activity. However, these policies did have severe public repercussions. These non-traditional restrictions caused social belonging, quality of education, human needs of safety, and financial security to be threatened.  Hence, it's essential to understand which government policies which include pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical inventions, had a positive turnaround in containing the spread and were truly worth implementing. This analysis can help the policymakers get more insights on what measures can be quickly implemented/ adjusted in the future if a similar situation were to arise, so as to ensure that the general public is not subjected to restrictions that perhaps don't yield the intended results.
Human mobility also plays an important role in the dynamics of infectious disease spread. By analyzing social mobility data, one can evaluate if changing social mobility in outdoor or indoor settings along with masking policies influenced COVID-19 infection spread in real-time as well. One of the motivations for this exercise is to understand if tracking human mobility both inclusive and exclusive of periods where mask mandates policies were in effect, through publicly available data sources can be used as an effective measure in identifying patterns in the COVID-19 spread.
The Kentucky state government (like other state governments) has implemented several policies at different time periods to help reduce the spread. However, it can be possible that the population responds differently to government interventions and that these differences can cause different human mobility patterns which leads the epidemic development to change. Hence, human mobility is a good additional factor that can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical inventions when analyzing the spread of COVID-19.

The main motivation of this analysis is to truly understand the effects of government interventions and human mobility on the spread of COVID-19 and to identify how these interventions and human mobility, in general, had a significant impact in reducing the COVID-19 spread in Jefferson County, Kentucky, US.
